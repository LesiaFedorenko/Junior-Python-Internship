### Install 
Using Docker. Run by command in data_project directory:

```
docker compose up -d
```


### Install Pipenv
Pipenv is a new popular way of automatically creating a 'virtualenv' for the project. It creates Pipfile and Pipfile.lock.
Install it by using pip:

```
pip install pipenv
```
For the application to work corretly, you need to install the neccessary Python libraries. For the installation of the libraries, use the following command:

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```
