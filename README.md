Pipenv is a new popular way of automatically creating a 'virtualenv' for the project. It creates Pipfile and Pipfile.lock.
Install it by using pip:

```

For the application to work corretly, you need to install the neccessary Python libraries. For the installation of the libraries, use the following command:

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```
